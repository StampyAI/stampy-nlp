[{"abstract": "Ttraditional safety engineering is coming to a turning point moving from deterministic, non-evolving systems operating in well-defined contexts to increasingly autonomous and learning-enabled AI systems which are acting in largely unpredictable operating contexts. We outline some of underlying challenges of safe AI and suggest a rigorous engineering framework for minimizing uncertainty, thereby increasing confidence, up to tolerable levels, in the safe behavior of AI systems.", "authors": ["Harald Rue\u00df", "Simon Burton"], "id": "2201.10436v2", "score": 0.864051461, "title": "Safe AI -- How is this Possible?", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10436v2"}]

{"answer": "high-level quantitative analysis of the contents", "context": "The database contains research works motivated by, and substantively informing, the challenge of ensuring the safety of TAI, including both technical and meta topics. This initial version of the database has attempted comprehensive coverage only for traditionally formatted research produced in 2016-2020 by organizations with a significant safety focus (~360 items). The database also has significant but non-comprehensive coverage (~570 items) of earlier years, less traditional formats (e.g., blog posts), and non-safety-focused organizations. Usefully, we also have citation counts for essentially all the items for which that is applicable. The core database takes the form of a Zotero library. Snapshots are also available as Google Sheet, CSV, and Zotero RDF. (Compact version for easier human reading: Google Sheet, CSV.) The rest of this post describes the composition of the database in more detail and presents some high-level quantitative analysis of the contents.", "end": 975, "id": "001-4DegbDJJiMX2b3EKm", "score": 0.002252846024930477, "start": 927, "title": "TAI Safety Bibliographic Database\n", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4DegbDJJiMX2b3EKm/tai-safety-bibliographic-database#:~:text=high-level%20quantitative%20analysis%20of%20the%20contents"}

{"answer": "publicly available datasets for high-stakes tasks", "context": "Experiments involve several publicly available datasets for high-stakes tasks, including recidivism prediction and weapon possession in stop-and-frisk searches. Across tasks, the data points include 3-7 categorical attributes and up to 28 binary features. The learned rule lists are 4 or 5 rules long, meaning it is very easy to read the entire rule list and see how it will handle every data point. The authors observe that on the recividism data, their approach achieves equal accuracy to a proprietary, blackbox \"prediction tool\" (COMPAS) used for recidivism prediction in some places in the US legal system. Lastly, the authors note that the search algorithm may struggle with very high dimensional data where many possibly relevant features are highly correlated.", "end": 77, "id": "140-GEPX7jgLMB8vR2qaK", "score": 0.04637671262025833, "start": 28, "title": "Opinions on Interpretable Machine Learning and 70 Summaries of Recent Papers\n", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GEPX7jgLMB8vR2qaK/opinions-on-interpretable-machine-learning-and-70-summaries#:~:text=publicly%20available%20datasets%20for%20high-stakes%20tasks"}

{"answer": "software-based automation in safety-critical domains", "context": "This chapter formulates seven lessons for preventing harm in artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on insights from the field of system safety for software-based automation in safety-critical domains. New applications of AI across societal domains and public organizations and infrastructures come with new hazards, which lead to new forms of harm, both grave and pernicious. The text addresses the lack of consensus for diagnosing and eliminating new AI system hazards. For decades, the field of system safety has dealt with accidents and harm in safety-critical systems governed by varying degrees of software-based automation and decision-making.", "end": 204, "id": "000-2202.09292v1", "score": 0.30626970529556274, "start": 152, "title": "System Safety and Artificial Intelligence", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09292v1#:~:text=software-based%20automation%20in%20safety-critical%20domains"}

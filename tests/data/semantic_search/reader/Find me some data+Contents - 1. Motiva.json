Conclusion Disclaimer: this post is a collection of preliminary thoughts around a specific question for MSFP\u203219 blogpost writing day. I do not intend to present novel results or define a research agenda. 1. Motivation The capital of Mozambique is Maputo. This is a fact about the world I learned in school many years ago. Some part of my brain must have changed in order to store this fact and allow me to remember it today. It may be possible, in principle, to recover this fact by simply looking at my brain. In this post, I consider an analogous topic in the context of Artificial Intelligence: is it possible to retrieve the knowledge stored in a neural network? This line of enquiry could be a step towards more transparent AI. 2.", "end": 739, "id": "000-22gPT6L5XEvHqW7bi", "score": 0.02337259240448475, "start": 713, "title": "Thoughts on Retrieving Knowledge from Neural Networks\n", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/22gPT6L5XEvHqW7bi/thoughts-on-retrieving-knowledge-from-neural-networks#:~:text=simply%20looking%20at%20my%20brain"}
